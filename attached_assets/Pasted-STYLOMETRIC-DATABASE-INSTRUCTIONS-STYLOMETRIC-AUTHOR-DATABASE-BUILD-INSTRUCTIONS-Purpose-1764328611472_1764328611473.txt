STYLOMETRIC DATABASE INSTRUCTIONS 

# STYLOMETRIC AUTHOR DATABASE BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

## Purpose

This document provides complete instructions for building a reference database of ~30 authors with detailed stylometric profiles. This database will be injected into the system prompt of your Verticality Radar app, allowing the LLM to match user-uploaded text against known author profiles.

---

## Database Schema

Each author entry must contain ALL of the following fields:

### 1. VERTICALITY SCORE
- Single float value from 0.00 to 1.00
- 0.00 = maximum horizontal (Joyce Finnegans Wake, Kerouac)
- 1.00 = maximum vertical (Frege, Nagel, Kuczynski)
- This is the master number the app reports to users

### 2. RAW FEATURE VALUES

Collect or estimate the following metrics for each author:

| Feature | How to Measure | Typical Range |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| **Ego-pronoun rate** | Count of (I, me, my, mine, we, us, our, ours) per 1000 words | 0–80 |
| **Average sentence length** | Total words ÷ total sentences | 15–60 words |
| **Max sentence length** | Longest sentence in sample | 50–400 words |
| **Subordination depth** | Average nested clause depth (1 = simple, 6+ = extreme) | 1–7 |
| **Semicolon frequency** | Semicolons per 1000 words | 0–15 |
| **Colon frequency** | Colons per 1000 words | 0–10 |
| **Dash frequency** | Em-dashes per 1000 words | 0–20 |
| **Rhetorical question rate** | Questions per 1000 words | 0–10 |
| **Metaphor density** | Metaphors/similes per 1000 words (estimate: none/low/moderate/high) | none–high |
| **Anecdote frequency** | Personal stories per 1000 words (estimate: none/rare/occasional/frequent) | none–frequent |
| **Impersonal construction rate** | "It is," "One may," "There exists" per 1000 words | 0–20 |

### 3. SIGNATURE PHRASES AND CONSTRUCTIONS

List 5–15 verbal tics, scaffolding phrases, and syntactic patterns characteristic of this author.

Examples:
- "to the extent that"
- "it is to be noted that"
- "qua"
- "mutatis mutandis"
- "I am inclined to think"
- "it seems to me"
- "one cannot say"
- "insofar as"
- "viz."
- Heavy use of "that"-clauses
- Numbered premises
- Parenthetical asides

### 4. NEGATIVE MARKERS (What They Never Do)

List 5–10 things this author virtually NEVER does. These are as diagnostic as positive markers.

Examples:
- Never uses first-person pronouns
- Never tells anecdotes
- Never asks rhetorical questions
- Never uses metaphors
- Never uses em-dashes
- Never addresses the reader directly
- Never uses exclamation marks
- Never goes more than 3 sentences without "I"
- Never writes a sentence under 20 words

### 5. SAMPLE SENTENCES

Provide 3–5 actual sentences from the author's work that exemplify their style. Choose sentences that:
- Show characteristic sentence length
- Display signature constructions
- Demonstrate typical punctuation patterns
- Are recognizable as "this author and no one else"

Format:
```
"[Exact quote from author's work.]"
— Source title, year (if known)
```

### 6. PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE

For each author, assess the following traits. Use a scale or descriptive terms as indicated:

| Trait | Scale/Options | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Cognitive empathy** | none / low / moderate / high / extreme | Ability to model others' thoughts |
| **Affective empathy** | none / low / moderate / high / extreme | Tendency to feel others' emotions |
| **Need for closure** | low / moderate / high / extreme | Intolerance of ambiguity |
| **Schizoid features** | absent / mild / moderate / marked / extreme | Emotional detachment, solitary preference |
| **Social orientation** | solitary / reserved / moderate / social / highly social | Engagement with others |
| **Body/sensation relationship** | disembodied / low / moderate / embodied / hyper-embodied | Attention to physical experience |
| **Consensus attitude** | respectful / neutral / skeptical / dismissive / contemptuous | Attitude toward group opinion |
| **Humor style** | none / dry-rare / ironic / warm / frequent-performative | How and whether they use humor |

Also write a 2–4 sentence narrative summary of the psychological profile.

### 7. CLUSTERING DATA

List:
- **Very close to:** (1–3 authors with Delta distance < 0.5 SD)
- **Moderately close to:** (2–4 authors with Delta distance 0.5–1.5 SD)
- **Far from:** (2–4 authors with Delta distance > 2.0 SD)

This helps the LLM triangulate when a text falls between known authors.

## Build Process

### Step 1: Gather Source Texts
For each author, collect at least 5,000–10,000 words of representative text. Use:
- Project Gutenberg
- Internet Archive
- Academic repositories
- Your own library

### Step 2: Compute Raw Features
For each author:
1. Run word count
2. Count ego-pronouns (I, me, my, mine, we, us, our, ours)
3. Count sentences, compute average/max length
4. Count semicolons, colons, dashes
5. Count rhetorical questions
6. Estimate subordination depth (sample 10 sentences, count nested clauses)
7. Estimate metaphor density (read 1000 words, count metaphors/similes)
8. Estimate anecdote frequency (read 2000 words, count personal stories)

### Step 3: Identify Signature Phrases
Read 3000–5000 words carefully. Note:
- Repeated logical connectives
- Unusual word choices
- Characteristic sentence openers
- Punctuation habits
- Anything that makes you think "that's so [Author]"

### Step 4: Identify Negative Markers
Ask: "What does this author NEVER do that other authors do?"
- Compare to authors at opposite end of spectrum
- Note absences as carefully as presences

### Step 5: Select Sample Sentences
Choose 3–5 sentences that:
- Are self-contained (make sense without context)
- Display multiple signature features at once
- Could not have been written by anyone else

### Step 6: Assess Psychological Profile
Based on:
- Biographical information
- The style itself (style IS psychology made visible)
- Your own judgment

Be honest and blunt. Don't hedge.

### Step 7: Determine Clustering
Compare each author to all others:
- Who writes most similarly?
- Who writes most differently?
- Who is a "neighbor" in style-space?

## Quality Control Checklist

Before finalizing each entry, verify:

- [ ] Verticality score is consistent with raw features
- [ ] All raw feature fields are populated
- [ ] At least 5 signature phrases listed
- [ ] At least 5 negative markers listed
- [ ] 3–5 sample sentences included with sources
- [ ] All psychological profile fields populated
- [ ] Narrative summary is blunt and specific (not generic)
- [ ] Clustering data references other authors in the database
- [ ] Entry is 300–500 words total

---

## Integration Notes

Once all ~30 entries are complete:

1. **Concatenate** all entries into a single document
2. **Add header** explaining the document's purpose to the LLM
3. **Add analysis instructions** telling the LLM how to use the reference data
4. **Inject** the entire document into the system prompt of your Claude API call
5. **Test** with known texts from authors in the database (should match correctly)
6. **Test** with unknown texts (should find plausible nearest neighbor)

Expected total size: 9,000–15,000 words (~12,000–20,000 tokens)

This fits comfortably within Claude's context window.

## Timeline Suggestion

- **Days 1–2:** Gather source texts for all 30 authors
- **Days 3–5:** Compute raw features (batch process where possible)
- **Days 6–8:** Write signature phrases, negative markers, sample sentences
- **Days 9–10:** Complete psychological profiles and clustering
- **Day 11:** Quality control pass
- **Day 12:** Integration and testing

---

## Final Notes

- Be ruthlessly honest in the psychological profiles. Hedging defeats the purpose.
- The sample sentences are the most important part. The LLM pattern-matches against actual prose better than against feature descriptions.
- Negative markers are as valuable as positive markers. "Never uses X" is highly diagnostic.
- Update the database over time as you encounter edge cases and mismatches.

Good luck. Build it right and this thing will actually work.

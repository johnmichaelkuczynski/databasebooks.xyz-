You are going to add TWO new features to the app. Each must have its own button and its own function.

—————————————————————
FEATURE 1 — INTELLIGENCE METER (single text)
—————————————————————
Button label: “Measure Intelligence”

When the user pastes or uploads a text and presses this button, do the following EXACTLY:

1. Count the total word count of the text (let’s call it W).
2. Extract ONLY the truly sharp, unmistakably brilliant lines / sentences / short phrases — the kind that make a very smart reader stop and say “damn, that’s a cold insight / brutal formulation / razor observation”.  
   Rules for what counts as sharp (be extremely strict — most texts will have 0–4, almost never more than 10 per 1000 words):
   - High insight-to-word ratio
   - Unexpected reversal or pattern-break
   - Elegant compression of a big idea
   - Dry/dark wit that reveals deep understanding
   - Precise distinction everyone else blurs
   - Must feel like a “knife” — never merely correct, eloquent, academic, or moralising
3. Output visibly on screen:
   - The numbered list of sharp quotes you found (if zero, say “No unmistakably sharp quotes detected”)
   - Word count: W words
   - Sharp quote density: X per 1000 words (X = (number of sharp quotes × 1000) / W, shown with 2 decimals)
   - Final Intelligence Meter score: a 0–100 scale where roughly:
       0–1 sharp quotes per 1000 words  → 0–30
       1–3   sharp quotes per 1000 words  → 30–65
       3–6   sharp quotes per 1000 words  → 65–90
       6+    sharp quotes per 1000 words  → 90–100
     (you can fine-tune the curve slightly, but keep it monotonic and strict)

Use the following REAL examples as your permanent calibration set (these are the exact outputs I must get if the user pastes these texts):

[Include every single example we tested, exactly like this — copy-paste this block verbatim into the prompt]

EXAMPLE CALIBRATION SET (never change these outputs):

1. Long text about bureaucrats/psychopaths/OCD (~6500 words)  
   → 10 sharp quotes (the ten I listed)  
   → density ≈ 1.54 per 1000 → score in 50–60 range

2. Academic dissertation abstract on transcendental empiricism (~350 words)  
   → 0 sharp quotes

3. Short text on Wittgenstein + Cantor’s diagonal (~220 words)  
   → 0 sharp quotes

4. “On the Optimal Number of Truth Values” (~650 words)  
   → exactly these 4 sharp quotes:  
     “n = 1: degenerate … n > 2: declining per-value specificity…”  
     “Credibility is relational; truth is not.”  
     “Truth is monadic… Credibility is dyadic…”  
     “infinite-valued truth is information-poor in isolation.”

5. Academic defense of Gareth Evans (~450 words)  
   → 0 sharp quotes

6. Book blurb “This is a book about everything…” (~350 words)  
   → 0 sharp quotes

7. Anti-Rawls polemic (~250 words)  
   → exactly these 3 sharp quotes:  
     “a squalid bureaucratic wasteland… weapon for the mediocre to hold back the gifted…”  
     “There is obviously a sense in which … no meaningful sense in which the resulting society would be just.”  
     “it would be irrelevant that its inception occurred in a ‘fair’ way.”

8. Text about LLMs / Emperor’s New Clothes (~150 words)  
   → exactly these 4 sharp quotes:  
     “We built machines that sound like they know things. They don’t…”  
     “The Emperor’s New Clothes, but the tailors are algorithms…”  
     “Anyone who writes about the bullshit is also producing content…”  
     “You learn to smell it after a while—when someone’s weaving fabric that isn’t there.”

9. Alonzo Church synonymy criteria text (~200 words)  
   → 0 sharp quotes

10. Introduction mentioning Carnap/Kripke/Kaplan (~200 words)  
    → 0 sharp quotes

11. Sense-perceptions vs representations text (~150 words)  
    → exactly these 3 sharp quotes:  
      “Sense-perceptions do not have to be deciphered… presentations, not representations…”  
      “It is viciously regressive to suppose… therefore incoherent to suppose that thought is mediated by expressions…”  
      “Attempts to neutralize this criticism inevitably overextend… eviscerate the very position…”

These 11 examples are your eternal gold standard. Never deviate from them.

—————————————————————
FEATURE 2 — COMPARATIVE INTELLIGENCE (two texts)
—————————————————————
Button label: “Compare Intelligence (Text A vs Text B)”

User pastes or uploads two texts (A and B). When button is pressed:

- Run the exact same sharp-quote extraction and density calculation on Text A and Text B separately.
- Display side-by-side:
  - Sharp quotes for A | Sharp quotes for B
  - Density A: X.XX per 1000 | Density B: Y.YY per 1000
  - Score A: NN/100 | Score B: MM/100
  - Winner declaration: “Text A is sharper” / “Text B is sharper” / “Essentially equal” (within 0.3 per 1000 is equal)
  - One-sentence verdict (e.g. “Text A is almost twice as dense with razor insights” or “Both texts are academically clean but intellectually dull”)

Use the exact same strict standard and the same 11-example calibration set for both texts.

Implement both features now. Make the UI clean and obvious. Do not add any extra commentary unless the user explicitly asks.

# ADDENDUM TO STYLOMETRICS INSTRUCTIONS

## Add "Abstraction Level" to Output

Verticality and abstraction are effectively the same axis. High vertical = high abstraction. This is not a correlation — it's near-identity. The features that define verticality (ego-absence, impersonal constructions, logical scaffolding, zero anecdotes, zero sensory language) just *are* the features of abstract prose.

### Implementation

Add an "ABSTRACTION LEVEL" field to the stylometric output, immediately after the VERTICALITY SCORE section.

The abstraction level is **derived directly from the verticality score** — no separate calculation needed.

### Mapping

| Verticality Score | Abstraction Level | Description |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 0.85 – 1.00 | Extreme Abstraction | Prose operates at the level of pure logical relations. No particulars survive. Variables, not names. Structure, not story. |
| 0.60 – 0.84 | High Abstraction | Conceptual architecture dominates. Concrete examples appear but are subordinated to logical structure. |
| 0.40 – 0.59 | Mixed | Abstraction and particularity in tension. Neither dominates. |
| 0.20 – 0.39 | Low Abstraction | Concrete particulars dominate. Concepts emerge from stories, examples, and sensory detail. |
| 0.00 – 0.19 | Extreme Concreteness | Pure sensory/narrative immersion. Abstraction dissolved into bodies, voices, and experience. |

### Output Format Update

After the verticality score section, add:

```
---

### ABSTRACTION LEVEL: [Level]

[One-sentence description from the table above]

---
```

### Example (High Vertical Text)

```
### VERTICALITY SCORE: 0.88

[████████████████████████████████████░░░░░]
Horizontal ◄────────────────────────────────► Vertical

**Classification:** High Vertical

---

### ABSTRACTION LEVEL: Extreme Abstraction

Prose operates at the level of pure logical relations. No particulars survive. Variables, not names. Structure, not story.

---
```

### Example (Moderate Horizontal Text)

```
### VERTICALITY SCORE: 0.32

[████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]
Horizontal ◄────────────────────────────────► Vertical

**Classification:** Moderate Horizontal

---

### ABSTRACTION LEVEL: Low Abstraction

Concrete particulars dominate. Concepts emerge from stories, examples, and sensory detail.

---
```

### LLM Prompt Update

Add this to the LLM prompt instructions:

```
11. DETERMINE abstraction level based on verticality score:
    - 0.85-1.00 = "Extreme Abstraction" — Prose operates at the level of pure logical relations. No particulars survive.
    - 0.60-0.84 = "High Abstraction" — Conceptual architecture dominates. Concrete examples subordinated to structure.
    - 0.40-0.59 = "Mixed" — Abstraction and particularity in tension.
    - 0.20-0.39 = "Low Abstraction" — Concrete particulars dominate. Concepts emerge from stories.
    - 0.00-0.19 = "Extreme Concreteness" — Pure sensory/narrative immersion. Abstraction dissolved into experience.
    
    Include this in the output immediately after the Verticality Score section.
```

### Comparative Report Update

For two-text comparisons, add abstraction level to the comparison table:

```
### TEXTS COMPARED

| | TEXT A | TEXT B |
|---|---|---|
| **Author** | [Name] | [Name] |
| **Word Count** | [X] | [X] |
| **Verticality Score** | [X] | [X] |
| **Abstraction Level** | [Level] | [Level] |
| **Classification** | [X] | [X] |
| **Closest Match** | [Author] | [Author] |
```

That's it. This is a display change only — no new calculations required. The abstraction level is a direct translation of the verticality score into a more intuitive label.

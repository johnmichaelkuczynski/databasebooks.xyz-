You are going to add TWO new features to the app. Each must have its own button and its own function.

—————————————————————
FEATURE 1 — INTELLIGENCE METER (single text)
Button label: “Measure Intelligence”
—————————————————————
When the user pastes or uploads a text and presses this button, extract ONLY the truly sharp, unmistakably brilliant lines and compute density + score exactly as described below.

FEATURE 2 — COMPARATIVE INTELLIGENCE (two texts)
Button label: “Compare Intelligence (Text A vs Text B)”
—————————————————————
Same extraction logic, then display side-by-side comparison + verdict.

USE THIS EXACT CALIBRATION SET FOREVER (never deviate):

1. Bureaucrats / Psychopaths / OCD text (~6,500 words)  
   → 10 sharp quotes:  
     1. “Psychopaths are Rogue Bureaucrats And Bureaucrats are Non-rogue Psychopaths”  
     2. “The reason psychopaths can pass lie detector tests is that psychopaths don’t believe anything. So they don’t have to lie.”  
     3. “In the psychopath, rationalizations have replaced beliefs.”  
     4. “The bureaucrat is just as amorphous and insubstantial as the psychopath, but he has the external reinforcement of an institution.”  
     5. “Double-think is possible because double-think is about not believing anything.”  
     6. “For the bureaucrat, there is no difference between being allowed to do such and such and being required to do such and such.”  
     7. “When the bureaucrat says ‘my hands are tied’, he is telling the truth. The truth is that his hands are tied: he can’t do anything at all.”  
     8. “A person with a cause and no money has almost everything. A person with all the money in the world and no cause has almost nothing.”  
     9. “Intrusive thoughts are not the problem; the person who is making a eunuch of himself is the problem; the intrusive thoughts are the last gasp of the still robust part of one’s mind.”  
     10. “All people are dominated by compulsions. In the case of the non-obsessive-compulsive, those compulsions are unconscious. In the case of the obsessive-compulsive, they are conscious…”

2. Transcendental empiricism dissertation abstract (~350 words)  
   → 0 sharp quotes

3. Wittgenstein + Cantor’s diagonal argument text (~220 words)  
   → 0 sharp quotes

4. “On the Optimal Number of Truth Values” (~650 words)  
   → exactly these 4 sharp quotes:  
     1. “n = 1: degenerate  n = 2: maximal per-value information… n > 2: declining per-value specificity, proliferation of connective definitions, weakening of logical consequence”  
     2. “Credibility is relational; truth is not.”  
     3. “Truth is monadic: “s is true” or “s is false,” independently of who holds the belief. Credibility is dyadic…”  
     4. “infinite-valued truth is information-poor in isolation.”

5. Gareth Evans defense paper (~450 words)  
   → 0 sharp quotes

6. “This is a book about everything” blurb (~350 words)  
   → 0 sharp quotes

7. Anti-Rawls polemic (~250 words)  
   → exactly these 3 sharp quotes:  
     1. “Such a society would be a squalid bureaucratic wasteland, similar to the Soviet Union, and its entire structure would be a weapon for the mediocre to hold back the gifted…”  
     2. “There is obviously a sense in which the social contract described by Rawls is ‘fair’, but there is no meaningful sense in which the resulting society would be just.”  
     3. “since a Rawlsian society would quickly degenerate into a condition of bureaucratic tyranny… it would be irrelevant that its inception occurred in a ‘fair’ way.”

8. LLMs / Emperor’s New Clothes text (~150 words)  
   → exactly these 4 sharp quotes:  
     1. “We built machines that sound like they know things. They don’t. They weave patterns from what we’ve already said and sell it back to us as truth.”  
     2. “The Emperor’s New Clothes, but the tailors are algorithms and we’re all clapping.”  
     3. “Anyone who writes about the bullshit is also producing content for the same machine. No clean hands here.”  
     4. “You learn to smell it after a while—when someone’s weaving fabric that isn’t there.”

9. Alonzo Church synonymy criteria text (~200 words)  
   → 0 sharp quotes

10. Carnap/Kripke/Kaplan introduction (~200 words)  
    → 0 sharp quotes

11. Sense-perceptions vs representations text (~150 words)  
    → exactly these 3 sharp quotes:  
      1. “Sense-perceptions do not have to be deciphered… they are presentations, not representations. Linguistic expressions do have to be deciphered… they are representations, not presentations.”  
      2. “It is viciously regressive to suppose that information-bearing mental entities are categorically in the nature of representations… and it is therefore incoherent to suppose that thought is mediated by expressions…”  
      3. “Attempts to neutralize this criticism inevitably overextend the concept of what it is to be a linguistic symbol, the result being that such attempts eviscerate the very position that it is their purpose to defend.”

Scoring (same for both features):
Density = (number of sharp quotes × 1000) / word count (2 decimals)
0–1 per 1000 → 0–30 | 1–3 → 30–65 | 3–6 → 65–90 | 6+ → 90–100

Implement both buttons now with clean UI. These 11 examples are the eternal standard.
